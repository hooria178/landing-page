											<h3>Heart Disease Predictor</h3>
											<p><strong>Languages: Python, HTML, CSS, TensorFlow library</strong></p>
											<p>I dove deep into the UC Irvine Heart Disease Dataset, conducting comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis. I employed strategic techniques for data structuring and processing, which really helped optimize our model's performance for the predictor app we were building. To develop robust predictive algorithms, I leveraged Python and TensorFlow, which proved to be powerful tools for this task. On the front-end side, I engineered an intuitive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This ensured that users could interact seamlessly with our application, easily input their data, and visualize the prediction results.</p>

											<h3>Recipe Converter</h3>
											<p><strong>Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong></p>
											<p>For my recipe scaling tool project, I took charge of the entire process - from conception to implementation. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface that really showcased my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What really made this project stand out was my ability to manage my time effectively and stay organized throughout. I had to learn a lot on my own as I went along, but that self-driven approach paid off. In the end, I managed to complete the entire project in just two weeks, which I feel demonstrates my ability to deliver results efficiently.</p>

											<h3>User Level Thread Library</h3>
											<p>I developed a basic user-level thread library for Linux using C. It was a complex task that really pushed my programming skills. To ensure the library worked correctly, I created a set of test scripts for automated feature testing, which was crucial for catching and fixing bugs quickly. What made this project particularly rewarding was the collaborative aspect. Our team worked together to set realistic coding milestones, which helped us stay on track throughout the design and implementation phases. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also taught me a lot about effective teamwork and project management in software development.</p>

											<h3>SShell</h3>
											<p>I developed a simple shell, which we called "sshell", using C programming. The main goal was to create a shell that could interpret and execute user input in the form of command lines, just like a typical UNIX terminal. It was a challenging but exciting process that really deepened my understanding of how operating systems work at a lower level. I implemented a variety of system calls that you'd typically find in UNIX-like operating systems, focusing on three main categories: processes, files, and pipes. This project not only improved my C programming skills but also gave me valuable insights into the inner workings of shell interfaces and operating system interactions.</p>

											<h3>FileSystem</h3>
											<p>I developed a complete FAT-based filesystem software stack using C. It was a comprehensive task that involved implementing core features like reading, writing, creating, and removing files. This project really pushed my programming skills and deepened my understanding of how filesystems work at a low level. What made this project particularly valuable was the collaborative aspect. I had to leverage my interpersonal and communication skills extensively, working closely with my team throughout the entire process. We collaborated on designing the system, developing the code, and then rigorously testing and debugging it.</p>

											<h3>Dished App: User Experience (UX) Design Project</h3>
											<p> I worked with a team to develop a prototype for a healthy lifestyle app using Figma. It was an exciting process that allowed me to apply my design skills in a practical setting. To ensure our app truly met user needs, I took charge of the user research phase. I conducted interviews with over 50 people, ranging from 18 to 52 years old, which gave us a wealth of valuable data to inform our design decisions. What I found particularly rewarding was seeing how our user-centric approach paid off. By implementing key insights from these interviews, we managed to significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction. In fact, we saw a 15% boost in user satisfaction scores, which was a huge win for our team and really validated our approach to app development.</p>
